very simple flask based project manager

This has been developed to learn about flask, and try to implement a relatively [ ... maybe ] usefull little project mananagment tool.

The basic idea is to allow the creation of *projects*, and *nested subtasks*.

## Projects
 * have an owner
 * have a project team


## Tasks ...
 *  may be assigned priorities
 *  have taget dates
 *  have owners
 *  have assignees
 *  may have sub tasks[recursively]
 

# Heroku

 These usere should work:
 
 "dougal","murphy","bill","ben"
 
 password = password
  
# dependancies

 * currently set up with progress
 * flask
 * sqlalchemy
 * Flask-WTF
 * flask-debugtoolbar
 * flask-nav
 * flask-login



# debug/devel
pip -e .
